Hi, I am Shuncio, a young Polish programmer who is **aspiring** to be **one of the best** in many fields (especially in IT) - to be a **Renaissance man**. I am in absolutely love with **history**, **JavaScript** (and its libraries) & **Pax Europaea age**! In love with the Airbnb JavaScript style guide.

```javascript
const goal = 'be a frontend developer.';
```

```javascript
const currentTask = 'currently I work on React currency converter app with usage of an external API';
```

I create **websites** and **web apps**. If you need any kind of help it will be a pleasure for me to give it to you!
```javascript
const frontendStack = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'ES6+', 'jQuery'];
```

```javascript
const backendStack = ['Node.js', 'Express.js'];
```

I want to continue mastering these great **technologies**:
```javascript
const codeTechnologies = ['Git', 'JSON', 'XML', 'NPM', 'Bash', 'Linux'];
```
